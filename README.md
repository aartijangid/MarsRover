# Exercise 1 : Mars Rover
 
A robot lands on Mars, which happens to be a cartesian grid; assuming that we hand the robot these instructions, such as LFFFRFFFRRFFF, where "L" is a "turn 90 degrees left", "R" is a "turn 90 degrees right", and "F" is "go forward one space, please write control code for the robot such that it ends up at the appropriate-and-correct destination, and include unit tests.

Here is an example output with command `"FF"`:

`[0, 2]`

## Initial Thoughts : 
Since we have been given with L, R and F as the valid command, we will keep updating direction and co-ordinates throughout the application.
